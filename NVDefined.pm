=head1 NAME

NVDefined - Perl extension for non-vivifying exists and defined functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use NVDefined;

  ...

  if (NVExists(\%hash, qw(key1 key2 ... keyn ))) {
      ...
  }

  if (NVDefined(\%hash, qw(key1 key2 ... keyn))) {
      ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When used on a hash, the exists() and defined() functions will create
entries in a hash in order to evaluate the function.

For instance, the code


The code

    %a = (a => 1, b=> 2);
    print "Doesn't exist\n" unless exists($a{c});
    print "Also Doesn't exist\n" unless exists($a{c}->{d});
    print "Oh, my, not good\n" if exists($a{c});

will print out:

    Doesn't exist
    Also Doesn't exist
    Oh, my, not good

The NVDefined module provides two functions, NVDefined() and
NVExists(), which avoid this, at the cost of a slightly convoluted
syntax. Both functions take a reference to a hash, followed by a list
of descending keys defining the hash entry to be investigated.
